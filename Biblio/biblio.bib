	abstract = {Cognitive robotics research draws inspiration from theories and models on cognition, as conceived by neuroscience or cognitive psychology, to investigate biologically plausible computational models in artificial agents. In this field, the theoretical framework of Grounded Cognition provides epistemological and methodological grounds for the computational modeling of cognition. It has been stressed in the literature that simulation, prediction, and multi-modal integration are key aspects of cognition and that computational architectures capable of putting them into play in a biologically plausible way are a necessity. Research in this direction has brought extensive empirical evidence, suggesting that Internal Models are suitable mechanisms for sensory–motor integration. However, current Internal Models architectures show several drawbacks, mainly due to the lack of a unified substrate allowing for a true sensory–motor integration space, enabling flexible and scalable ways to model cognition under the embodiment hypothesis constraints. We propose the Self-Organized Internal Models Architecture (SOIMA), a computational cognitive architecture coded by means of a network of self-organized maps, implementing coupled internal models that allow modeling multi-modal sensory–motor schemes. Our approach addresses integrally the issues of current implementations of Internal Models. We discuss the design and features of the architecture, and provide empirical results on a humanoid robot that demonstrate the benefits and potentialities of the SOIMA concept for studying cognition in artificial agents.},

	abstract = {Recent anatomical and electrophysiological evidence in primates indicates the presence of direct connections between primary auditory and primary visual cortex that constitute cross-modal systems. We examined the intrinsic functional connectivity (fcMRI) of putative primary auditory cortex in 32 young adults during resting state scanning. We found that the medial Heschl’s gyrus was strongly coupled, in particular, to visual cortex along the anterior banks of the calcarine ﬁssure. This observation was conﬁrmed using novel group-level, tensor-based independent components analysis. fcMRI analysis revealed that although overall coupling between the auditory and visual cortex was signiﬁcantly reduced when subjects performed a visual perception task, coupling between the anterior calcarine cortex and auditory cortex was not disrupted. These results suggest that primary auditory cortex has a functionally distinct relationship with the anterior visual cortex, which is known to represent the peripheral visual ﬁeld. Our study provides novel, fcMRI-based, support for a neural system involving low-level auditory and visual cortices. Hum Brain Mapp 29:848–857, 2008. VC 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	title = {From modularity to emergence: a primer on the design and science of complex systems},
	shorttitle = {From modularity to emergence},
	abstract = {Electrical networks, flocking birds, transportation hubs, weather patterns, commercial organisations, swarming robots... Increasingly, many of the systems that we want to engineer or understand are said to be ‘complex’. These systems are often considered to be intractable because of their unpredictability, non-linearity, interconnectivity, heterarchy and ‘emergence’. Such attributes are often framed as a problem, but can also be exploited to encourage systems to efficiently exhibit intelligent, robust, self-organising behaviours. But what does it mean to describe systems as complex? How do these complex systems differ from the more easily understood ‘modular’ systems that we are familiar with? What are the underlying similarities between different systems, whether modular or complex? Answering these questions is a first step in approaching the design and science of complexity. However, to do so, it is necessary to look beyond the specifics of any particular system or field of study. We need to consider the fundamental nature of systems, looking for a common way to view ostensibly different phenomena. This primer introduces a domain-neutral framework and diagrammatic scheme for characterising the ways in which systems are modular or complex. Rather than seeing modularity and complexity as inherent attributes of systems, we instead see them as ways in which those systems are characterised by those who are interested in them. The framework is not tied to any established mode of representation (e.g. networks, equations, formal modelling languages) nor to any domain-specific terminology (e.g. ‘vertex’, ‘eigenvector’, ‘entropy’). Instead, it consists of basic system constructs and three fundamental attributes of modular system architecture, namely structural encapsulation, function-structure mapping and interfacing. These constructs and attributes encourage more precise descriptions of different aspects of complexity (e.g. emergence, self-organisation, heterarchy). This allows researchers and practitioners from different disciplines to share methods, theories and findings related to the design and study of different systems, even when those systems appear superficially dissimilar.},

The emergence of the field of embodied intelligence is closely linked to parallel developments in computational intelligence and robotics, where the focus is on morphological computation and sensory–motor coordination in evolutionary robotics models, and in neuroscience and cognitive sciences where the focus is on embodied cognition and developmental robotics models of embodied symbol learning. This chapter provides a theoretical and technical overview of some principles of embodied intelligence, namely morphological computation, sensory–motor coordination, and developmental embodied cognition. It will also discuss some tutorial examples on the modeling of body/brain/environment adaptation for the evolution of morphological computational agents, evolutionary robotics model of navigation and object discrimination, and developmental robotics models of language and numerical cognition in humanoid robots.},

	abstract = {Of the various attempts to generalize information theory to multiple variables, the most widely utilized, interaction information, suffers from the problem that it is sometimes negative. Here we reconsider from first principles the general structure of the information that a set of sources provides about a given variable. We begin with a new definition of redundancy as the minimum information that any source provides about each possible outcome of the variable, averaged over all possible outcomes. We then show how this measure of redundancy induces a lattice over sets of sources that clarifies the general structure of multivariate information. Finally, we use this redundancy lattice to propose a definition of partial information atoms that exhaustively decompose the Shannon information in a multivariate system in terms of the redundancy between synergies of subsets of the sources. Unlike interaction information, the atoms of our partial information decomposition are never negative and always support a clear interpretation as informational quantities. Our analysis also demonstrates how the negativity of interaction information can be explained by its confounding of redundancy and synergy.},

Traditional tools and approaches to study this architecture have largely focused on single scales—of topology, time, and space. Expanding beyond this narrow view, we focus this review on pertinent questions and novel methodological advances for the multi-scale brain. We separate our exposition into content related to multi-scale topological structure, multi-scale temporal structure, and multi-scale spatial structure. In each case, we recount empirical evidence for such structures, survey network-based methodological approaches to reveal these structures, and outline current frontiers and open questions. Although predominantly peppered with examples from human neuroimaging, we hope that this account will offer an accessible guide to any neuroscientist aiming to measure, characterize, and understand the full richness of the brain's multiscale network structure—irrespective of species, imaging modality, or spatial resolution.},

	abstract = {The self-organizing map (SOM) is an automatic data-analysis method. It is widely applied to clustering problems and data exploration in industry, finance, natural sciences, and linguistics. The most extensive applications, exemplified in this paper, can be found in the management of massive textual databases and in bioinformatics. The SOM is related to the classical vector quantization (VQ), which is used extensively in digital signal processing and transmission. Like in VQ, the SOM represents a distribution of input data items using a finite set of models. In the SOM, however, these models are automatically associated with the nodes of a regular (usually two-dimensional) grid in an orderly fashion such that more similar models become automatically associated with nodes that are adjacent in the grid, whereas less similar models are situated farther away from each other in the grid. This organization, a kind of similarity diagram of the models, makes it possible to obtain an insight into the topographic relationships of data, especially of high-dimensional data items. If the data items belong to certain predetermined classes, the models (and the nodes) can be calibrated according to these classes. An unknown input item is then classified according to that node, the model of which is most similar with it in some metric used in the construction of the SOM. A new finding introduced in this paper is that an input item can even more accurately be represented by a linear mixture of a few best-matching models. This becomes possible by a least-squares fitting procedure where the coefficients in the linear mixture of models are constrained to nonnegative values.},
