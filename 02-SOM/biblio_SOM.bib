	abstract = {The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is widely used, easy to implement, has nice properties for data mining by providing both clustering and visual representation. It acts as an extension of the k-means algorithm that preserves as much as possible the topological structure of the data. However, since its conception, the mathematical study of the SOM remains diﬃcult and has be done only in very special cases. In WSOM 2005, Jean-Claude Fort presented the state of the art, the main remaining diﬃculties and the mathematical tools that can be used to obtain theoretical results on the SOM outcomes. These tools are mainly Markov chains, the theory of Ordinary Diﬀerential Equations, the theory of stability, etc. This article presents theoretical advances made since then. In addition, it reviews some of the many SOM algorithm variants which were deﬁned to overcome the theoretical diﬃculties and/or adapt the algorithm to the processing of complex data such as time series, missing values in the data, nominal data, textual data, etc.},

But, on the other hand, its theoretical properties still remain without proof in the general case, despite the great eﬀorts of several authors. In this paper, we pass in review the last results and provide some conjectures for the future work.},

	doi = {10.1109/IJCNN.1990.137727},
	abstract = {The topological feature map (TFM) algorithm introduced by T. Kohenen (1982) implements two important properties: a vector quantization (VQ) and a topology-preserving mapping. A tree-structured TFM (TSTFM) is presented as a computationally inexpensive alternative to the TFM algorithm. The computational complexity of the TSTFM is O (log N) rather than O(N) for the TFM. In addition, the TSTFM has some new properties that prove to be useful for VQ and in the context of visual perception: increased performance in VQ compared to the tree-structured VQ of A. Buzo et al. (1980) and hierarchical mapping of code vectors},

	doi = {10.1109/72.846732},
	abstract = {The growing self-organizing map (GSOM) algorithm is presented in detail and the effect of a spread factor, which can be used to measure and control the spread of the GSOM, is investigated. The spread factor is independent of the dimensionality of the data and as such can be used as a controlling measure for generating maps with different dimensionality, which can then be compared and analyzed with better accuracy. The spread factor is also presented as a method of achieving hierarchical clustering of a data set with the GSOM. Such hierarchical clustering allows the data analyst to identify significant and interesting clusters at a higher level of the hierarchy, and continue with finer clustering of the interesting clusters only. Therefore, only a small map is created in the beginning with a low spread factor, which can be generated for even a very large data set. Further analysis is conducted on selected sections of the data and of smaller volume. Therefore, this method facilitates the analysis of even very large data sets.},
